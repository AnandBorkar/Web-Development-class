# Web-Development-class
Web is a collection of websites connected through the Internet.

We open the web using a browser like Chrome or Edge.

Web allows users to:

Read information
Fill forms
Watch videos
Use applications (Gmail, WhatsApp Web)
Examples: Google, YouTube, Amazon

A website is a collection of web pages. Each web page is written using HTML.

Websites can be:

Static: Only show information
Dynamic: User interaction like login and forms
Web development means building websites or web applications.

It has three main parts:

Frontend: What users see
Backend: Logic and server
Database: Stores data
In this course, we focus on Frontend.

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.

HTML tells the browser what to show on the page.

HTML is NOT a programming language. HTML is a markup language.

How Browser Works (High Level):

User types a URL
Browser sends request to server
Server sends HTML, CSS, JS
Browser reads HTML
Browser applies CSS
Browser runs JavaScript
Page is shown to the user
HTML vs CSS vs JavaScript: HTML: Structure CSS: Styling JavaScript: Logic

Real-life analogy: HTML is Body CSS is Clothes JavaScript is Brain
